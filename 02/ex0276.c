// Why is it not a good idea for an identifier to contain more than
// one adjacent underscore (as in current___balance, for example?)

// Answer: because it can be misspelled later in the code.
// For example if it's defined with 3 underscores, later in the code a
// programmer might use the identifier with 2 underscores instead.
